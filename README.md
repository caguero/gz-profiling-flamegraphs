## Prerequisites

```bash
# Install perf
sudo apt install linux-tools-$(uname -r)

# Clone FlameGraph scripts
git clone https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph

# Allow user-mode profiling (resets on reboot)
sudo sysctl kernel.perf_event_paranoid=1
```

### Additional permissions for extended analysis

The core CPU flamegraph and cache analysis scripts work with `perf_event_paranoid=1`. The extended analysis scripts have additional requirements:

| Script | Requirement | Command |
|---|---|---|
| `gz_offcpu_flamegraph.sh` | eBPF (needs root) | `sudo apt install bpfcc-tools` |
| `gz_false_sharing.sh` | Works at `paranoid=1` | (no extra permissions) |
| `gz_sched_analysis.sh` | Uses `/proc/schedstat` | (no extra permissions) |
| `gz_per_thread_flamegraph.sh` | Post-processing only | (no extra permissions) |
| `gz_diff_flamegraph.sh` | Post-processing only | (no extra permissions) |

All `sysctl` settings reset on reboot.

## Build Configuration

Build your Gazebo workspace with debug symbols and frame pointers. Use `ENABLE_PROFILER=OFF` for clean flamegraph captures (discovery phase). Use `ENABLE_PROFILER=ON` for before/after optimization validation with Remotery.

```bash
cd <GZ_WS>
colcon build --merge-install \
  --cmake-args -DENABLE_PROFILER=OFF \
               -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo \
               -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-fno-omit-frame-pointer" \
               -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS="-fno-omit-frame-pointer"
```

## Running Captures

### Environment Setup

Source your workspace and set the required environment variables before running any capture script:

```bash
source <GZ_WS>/install/setup.bash
export GZ_CONFIG_PATH=<GZ_WS>/install/share/gz:$GZ_CONFIG_PATH
export GZ_SIM_MAIN=<GZ_WS>/install/libexec/gz/sim/gz-sim-main
export FLAMEGRAPH_DIR=~/FlameGraph
```

### Capture All Worlds

```bash
# Capture all worlds in the provided directory
./scripts/capture_all.sh worlds/

# Runtime captures only (skip loading)
./scripts/capture_all.sh worlds/ --runtime-only

# Loading captures only (skip runtime)
./scripts/capture_all.sh worlds/ --loading-only

# Full analysis: CPU + cache + off-CPU + false sharing + scheduler
./scripts/capture_all.sh worlds/ --full

# Selective extended analysis
./scripts/capture_all.sh worlds/ --with-offcpu --with-sched

# Use your own worlds
./scripts/capture_all.sh /path/to/my/worlds/
```

Output goes to `captures/runtime/` and `captures/loading/` under the current working directory. When satisfied with the results, publish them to the repository (see [Publishing a Run](#publishing-a-run)).

### Capture a Single World

```bash
# Runtime: 30s steady-state capture
./scripts/gz_flamegraph.sh worlds/jetty.sdf jetty 30 headless

# With sensor subscribers (for rendering-sensor worlds)
./scripts/gz_flamegraph.sh worlds/gpu_lidar_sensor.sdf gpu_lidar 30 headless-rendering /lidar

# Loading: startup + 1 iteration
./scripts/gz_loading_flamegraph.sh worlds/jetty.sdf jetty
```

### Sensor Worlds

For worlds with rendering sensors, the sensor pipeline skips work unless there's a subscriber. Two ways to handle this:

1. **Companion `.topics` file**: create `<world>.topics` alongside the SDF with one topic per line. `capture_all.sh` reads this automatically.
2. **Command-line topics**: pass topics as extra arguments to `gz_flamegraph.sh`.

### Custom Worlds

To add a new benchmark world:

1. Copy the SDF to your worlds directory
2. Set `<real_time_factor>0</real_time_factor>` in the `<physics>` element to run at maximum speed
3. If it has rendering sensors, create a `.topics` companion file
4. Run `capture_all.sh` pointing to your directory

### Analyzing Hotspots

After capturing, use `gz_hotspots.sh` to automatically identify Gazebo-owned optimization targets:

```bash
./scripts/gz_hotspots.sh 2026-04-21/runtime/3k_shapes_static.folded
./scripts/gz_hotspots.sh 2026-04-21/runtime/jetty_headless.folded 20  # top 20
```

Outputs: optimization targets (inclusive time), attribution (which Gazebo function calls which external cost), external context, and a summary of how much CPU runs under Gazebo code.

### CPU Cache Analysis

Measure cache miss rates and Instructions Per Cycle (IPC) to determine if a workload is compute-bound or memory-bound:

```bash
# Measure a running simulation for 10 seconds
./scripts/gz_cache_stats.sh --pid $PID 10

# Measure loading performance
./scripts/gz_cache_stats.sh --load worlds/3k_shapes_static.sdf

# Measure all running simulations at once
./scripts/gz_cache_stats.sh --all-runtime

# Measure loading for all worlds
./scripts/gz_cache_stats.sh --all-loading worlds/
```

IPC interpretation: 2-4 = healthy (compute-bound), 1-2 = moderate, <1 = memory-bound (CPU stalled on RAM).

### Cache-Miss Flamegraphs

Generate flamegraphs showing WHERE cache misses happen (not CPU time):

```bash
# Runtime: capture cache misses from a running world
./scripts/gz_cache_flamegraph.sh --runtime worlds/3k_shapes_static.sdf 3k_static 30

# Loading: capture cache misses during startup
./scripts/gz_cache_flamegraph.sh --loading worlds/jetty.sdf jetty
```

### CPU vs Cache-Miss Comparison

Compare CPU flamegraphs with cache-miss flamegraphs to identify cache-hostile functions:

```bash
./scripts/gz_compare_cpu_cache.sh captures/runtime/3k_shapes_static.folded captures/cache/3k_static_rt_cachemiss.folded
```

Output shows cache ratio per function: >1.3 = cache-hostile (needs data layout fix), <0.7 = cache-friendly (needs algorithmic fix).

### Off-CPU Flamegraphs

Capture where threads **block** (mutexes, I/O, condition waits) — complementary to CPU flamegraphs:

```bash
# Runtime: capture off-CPU events from a running world
./scripts/gz_offcpu_flamegraph.sh worlds/jetty.sdf jetty 10 headless

# Attach to a running process
./scripts/gz_offcpu_flamegraph.sh --pid $PID jetty 10
```

Requires sudo access (eBPF programs need root) and `bpfcc-tools` installed (`sudo apt install bpfcc-tools`).

### False Sharing Detection

Detect cacheline contention between threads using `perf c2c`:

```bash
# Runtime: capture HITM events from a running world
./scripts/gz_false_sharing.sh --runtime worlds/3k_shapes.sdf 3k_dynamic 5

# Analyze existing perf c2c data
./scripts/gz_false_sharing.sh --analyze captures/c2c/perf_jetty_c2c.data jetty
```

High HITM rates on a symbol indicate threads writing to different data that shares a cache line.

### Scheduler Analysis

Measure per-thread scheduling delays that affect real-time simulation:

```bash
./scripts/gz_sched_analysis.sh worlds/jetty.sdf jetty 10
```

Flags threads where average scheduling delay exceeds `SCHED_THRESHOLD_MS` (default 1.0ms). Uses `/proc/PID/schedstat` — no special permissions needed.

### Per-Thread Flamegraphs

Split an existing perf capture into one flamegraph per thread:

```bash
./scripts/gz_per_thread_flamegraph.sh captures/runtime/perf_jetty.data jetty
```

Post-processing only — works on existing `perf_*.data` files without re-capturing.

### Differential Flamegraphs

Compare before/after captures to validate optimizations:

```bash
./scripts/gz_diff_flamegraph.sh baseline.folded optimized.folded my_optimization
```

Red = regression, blue = improvement. Also generates a TSV of top changes.

### Unified Summary

Combine all analysis dimensions into a single ranked priority list:

```bash
./scripts/gz_summary.sh captures/ jetty
```

Produces a composite score (0-100) per function combining CPU time, cache hostility, off-CPU blocking, false sharing, and scheduler impact.

### Interactive Analysis with KDAB Hotspot

For deep interactive exploration with per-thread timelines, install [KDAB Hotspot](https://github.com/KDAB/hotspot):

```bash
sudo apt install hotspot
hotspot captures/runtime/perf_jetty.data
```

Click any thread in the timeline to filter all views (flamegraph, top-down, bottom-up) to that thread.

### Full Pipeline (end-to-end)

Run everything in one command — capture all worlds, analyze, and produce a ranked list of optimization targets:

```bash
# Full pipeline: capture + analyze + cross-world ranking
./scripts/gz_full_pipeline.sh worlds/

# Skip capture, analyze existing data
./scripts/gz_full_pipeline.sh worlds/ --skip-capture

# Full pipeline + publish to repository
./scripts/gz_full_pipeline.sh worlds/ --publish
```

The main output is `captures/summary/cross_world_summary.tsv` — a single ranked list showing each Gazebo function's composite score, how many worlds it affects, and multi-dimensional evidence.

For post-capture analysis only (no simulation needed):

```bash
# Analyze existing captures: hotspots + per-thread + cache comparison + cross-world merge
./scripts/gz_analyze.sh captures/
```

### Publishing a Run

Two options:

```bash
# Option A: One-shot (capture + analyze + publish in one command)
./scripts/gz_full_pipeline.sh worlds/ --publish
git add 2026-05-02/ && git commit -m "Add profiling run 2026-05-02" && git push

# Option B: Iterative (inspect results before publishing)
./scripts/gz_full_pipeline.sh worlds/
# ... inspect captures/summary/cross_world_summary.tsv, re-run if needed ...
./scripts/gz_publish_run.sh captures/
git add 2026-05-02/ && git commit -m "Add profiling run 2026-05-02" && git push
```

`gz_publish_run.sh` will:
- Create a `YYYY-MM-DD/` directory with `runtime/`, `loading/`, `cache/`, `c2c/`, `sched/`, `threads/`, `summary/`
- Copy `.svg`, `.folded`, `.tsv` files (skip large `perf_*.data` — those stay local)
- Run `gz_hotspots.sh` and `gz_summary.sh` on all worlds if not already done
- Generate `YYYY-MM-DD/index.html` with links to all flamegraphs and analysis reports
- Update the top-level `index.html` to include the new run

Options:
```bash
# Custom date
./scripts/gz_publish_run.sh captures/ --date 2026-05-02

# With description for the index page
./scripts/gz_publish_run.sh captures/ --description "After EachNoCache fix"
```
